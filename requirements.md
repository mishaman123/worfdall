# WordFall Game Requirements

## Game Overview
WordFall is a letter-swapping puzzle game where players rearrange letters on a grid to form valid words. After words are formed, the letters disappear and remaining letters fall down to fill the empty spaces, creating a cascading effect.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Grid System
- The game uses a multi-dimensional grid of letter cells
- Grid size is flexible but typically up to 20x20 cells
- Each cell contains a single letter or can be empty
- Empty cells are visually distinct from letter cells
- The grid should be centered and responsive to different screen sizes

### Letter Swapping
- Players can select and swap two adjacent letters
- Adjacent means horizontally, vertically, or diagonally neighboring
- The swap is only valid if it creates at least two valid words
- Swapped letters should have a clear animation to indicate the swap
- Invalid swaps should provide clear visual feedback

### Word Detection
- After a swap, the game checks for valid words in both horizontal and vertical directions
- Valid words are defined in the level data and must be at least 3 letters long
- Words can be formed in any position within the grid that creates a consecutive sequence
- When valid words are detected, they should be visually highlighted
- Words are detected in both horizontal and vertical orientations

### Cascading Effect
1. When valid words are formed, a sequence of animations plays:
   - Words are highlighted with a cascading reveal animation
   - Highlighted letters fade out
   - Remaining letters above empty spaces fall down to fill the gaps
2. The falling animation should be smooth and visually appealing
3. Letters should fall straight down, maintaining their column position

### Level Completion
- A level is completed when all letters are cleared from the grid
- The game should track the number of remaining letters
- When no letters remain, the level completion is triggered
- A transition screen should appear between levels

## User Interface Requirements

### Game Grid
- The game grid should be clearly visible and centered
- Letter cells should be easy to read and interact with
- Selected cells should have a distinct visual state
- Animations should provide clear feedback for game actions

### Visual States for Grid Cells
- Normal state: White background with dark text
- Selected state: Blue background with white text
- Selected for swap: Green background with white text
- Valid word: Green background with white text and highlight animation
- Single word found (not enough for valid swap): Orange/yellow highlight with pulse animation
- Invalid swap: Red background with shake animation
- Fading out: Gradual fade animation
- Empty: Visually distinct from letter cells

### Animations
1. **Selection Animation**: Scale increase for selected cells
2. **Swap Animation**: Transition between cells with scale effect
3. **Invalid Swap Animation**: Shake effect with red highlight
4. **Word Found Animation**: Cascading reveal with green highlight
5. **Fading Animation**: Gradual disappearance of letters
6. **Falling Animation**: Gravity effect for letters filling empty spaces
7. **Level Transition Animation**: Fade in/out between levels

### Responsive Design
- The game should be playable on devices of various sizes
- Grid and UI elements should adapt to screen size
- Smaller screens should have appropriately sized cells and spacing
- Mobile-friendly touch interactions

## Game Flow

### Game States
1. **Start Screen**: Introduction to the game
2. **Playing**: Active gameplay with the letter grid
3. **Level Transition**: Screen showing progress to next level
4. **Game Complete**: Final screen after all levels are completed

### Level Structure
- Each level has a unique ID, name, theme, and grid layout
- Levels define a set of valid words related to the theme
- The grid contains strategically placed letters that can form the valid words
- Level difficulty increases progressively

## Level Creation Requirements

### Level Data Structure
- **ID**: Unique identifier for the level
- **Name**: Descriptive name for the level
- **Theme**: Thematic category for the words
- **Grid**: 2D array defining the initial letter placement
- **Valid Words**: Array of words that can be formed and detected

### Level Design Principles
1. Letters should be arranged so that valid swaps are possible
2. Each level should have multiple possible solutions
3. Words should be related to the level's theme
4. The grid should be designed with the cascading mechanic in mind
5. Words must be at least 3 letters long

### Level Creator Tool (Development Feature)
- Tool for creating and testing new game levels
- Accessible by pressing 'L' key (development mode only)
- Allows designers to:
  - Define grid size
  - Input valid words
  - Test level playability
  - Save level configurations

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Animations should run smoothly at 60fps
- The game should load quickly and respond immediately to user input
- Complex calculations (like word detection) should not cause perceptible lag

### Browser Compatibility
- The game should work on all modern browsers
- Mobile browser support is required
- Touch and mouse interactions should be equally supported

### Accessibility
- Color schemes should account for color blindness
- Text should have sufficient contrast
- Interactive elements should be clearly identifiable
- The game should be playable with keyboard (where appropriate)

## Development Features (Only in Dev Mode)

These features are only enabled when running the app locally or with specific URL parameters:

1. **Level Switcher**: Quick navigation between game levels for testing
2. **Level Creator**: Tool for creating and testing new game levels
3. **Feature Flags**: URL parameters to enable/disable development features
   - `?dev=true` - Enable all development features
   - `?features=true` - Enable all development features
   - `?levelSwitcher=true` - Enable only the Level Switcher
   - `?levelCreator=true` - Enable only the Level Creator

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

These are potential features to be considered for future development:

1. **Scoring System**: Points awarded based on word length, difficulty, or speed
2. **Hint System**: Optional hints for players who are stuck
3. **Time Challenge Mode**: Complete levels within time limits
4. **Word Categories**: Different themes and word categories
5. **Achievements**: Rewards for completing specific challenges
6. **Tutorial Levels**: Guided introduction to game mechanics
7. **Social Features**: Sharing scores, challenging friends
8. **Custom Word Lists**: Allow players to create custom word sets

## Bug Prevention Guidelines

When implementing new features or fixing bugs, ensure:

1. Words are correctly detected in both horizontal and vertical directions
2. The letter cascading effect works properly after words are removed
3. Swapped letters create valid words as defined in the level data
4. Level completion is correctly triggered when all letters are cleared
5. Animations complete properly without visual glitches
6. The game is responsive across different device sizes
7. User interactions work consistently (selection, swapping, etc.)
8. Development features are disabled in production builds
